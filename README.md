Users can try to beat the computer by finding all of the computer's battleships before the computer finds theirs.

 Each battleship occupies one square on the board.

## How to play

Ultimate Battleships is based on the classic pen and paper game. You can read more about it [Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

In this version, the player enters their name, and two boards are randomly generated.

The player can see where their ships are, indicated by an '@' sign, but cannot see where the computer's ships are.

Guesses are marked on the board with an 'X', while hits are indicated by '*'.

The player takes turns to make guesses and try to sink the battleships, while at the same time, the computer tries to hit the player's ships.

The winner is the one who sinks all of their opponent's battleships first.
